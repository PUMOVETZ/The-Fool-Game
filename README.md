# The-Fool-Game


This project aims to develop a computer vision system that can recognize and identify playing cards placed on a table. The system utilizes Python and the OpenCV library to process and analyze images from a screen. After card recognition, I want to add the ability to play cards with a person using a machine learning-based algorithm. The project will be divided into two stages:

1. Card and Event Recognition
2. Full-fledged Human-Player Game


## Using Libraries

1. OpenCV
2. Numpy

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
