# The-Fool-Game


This project aims to develop a computer vision system that can recognize and identify playing cards placed on a table. The system utilizes Python and the OpenCV library to process and analyze images from a screen. After card recognition, I want to add the ability to play cards with a person using a machine learning-based algorithm. The project will be divided into two stages:

1. Card and Event Recognition
2. Full-fledged Human-Player Game


## Using Libraries

1. OpenCV
2. Numpy
3. Tesseract

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install all libraries and follow all steps from official sites.

## Card and Event Recognition
We made dataset from cards and start model learning. 

## AI Player
A few moments later.....

## Timeline
1. Add cards finder.
2. Add rectangle drawer.
3. Trying to add cards recognition with rank and suit.
4. Now we have understood that we need to use AI to recognise cards on the table, because recognising text is difficult and cant get 100% result.
